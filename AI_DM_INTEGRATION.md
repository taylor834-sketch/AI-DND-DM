# 🤖 AI DM Integration System

## Overview

The AI DM Integration system provides a comprehensive framework for AI Dungeon Masters to interact with all D&D Voice Adventure databases while maintaining consistency, safety, and natural storytelling flow. This system ensures the AI has complete context while preventing database corruption or inconsistencies.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AIDMIntegration** (`ai-dm-integration.js`): Main integration hub
2. **InteractionHistory** (`interaction-history.js`): Comprehensive interaction tracking
3. **AIDMInterface** (`ai-dm-interface.js`): User interface for testing and management

### Integration Points

- **World Database**: All entities (NPCs, locations, quests, factions)
- **Relationship System**: Trust levels, faction reputations, approval ratings
- **Monster Database**: Creature stats, encounters, player knowledge
- **Character Sheet**: Party status, resources, abilities
- **Campaign Manager**: Current location, objectives, world state

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Context Building System

The AI DM receives comprehensive, token-managed context including:

**Critical Context (Always Included)**:
- Current location with connections, NPCs, and threats
- Party status (level, health, resources, active effects)
- Active quests with priorities and current steps

**Important Context (Token Budget Permitting)**:
- Relevant relationships with trust levels and recent changes
- Recent events filtered by importance and location
- NPCs in current area with personality traits and connections
- Enhanced location details with faction presence and danger assessment

**Supplementary Context (Remaining Budget)**:
- World history summary with major events
- Faction status and conflicts
- Known monster information and weaknesses
- Environmental context (time, weather, mood)

### 🏷️ Entity Creation System

The AI can create new entities using structured tags:

```
[NEW_CHARACTER: Name | Role | Description]
[NEW_LOCATION: Name | Type | Description]  
[NEW_MONSTER: Name | Challenge Level | Description]
[NEW_FACTION: Name | Type | Description]
[NEW_QUEST: Name | Priority | Description]
```

**Safety Features**:
- Automatic validation of entity data
- Duplicate detection and reference
- Creation limits per response
- Relationship initialization for NPCs

### 💫 Relationship Management

Automatic relationship updates using:

```
[UPDATE_RELATIONSHIP: NPC Name | Change (+/-) | Reason]
```

**Features**:
- Bounded changes (max ±50 per request)
- Cascading faction effects
- Historical tracking with reasons
- Consistency validation

### 📜 Quest Progression

Quest updates through:

```
[UPDATE_QUEST: Quest Name | New Status | Details]
```

**Capabilities**:
- Status progression tracking

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### For AI DMs

1. **Context Generation**: Request context for specific situation types
2. **Response Processing**: Use structured tags for database changes
3. **History Reference**: Access relevant past interactions
4. **Safety Compliance**: Stay within established limits

### Example AI DM Response

```
The tavern falls silent as Gareth the Blacksmith bursts through the door, his face flushed with panic.

[NEW_CHARACTER: Gareth | Blacksmith | Panic-stricken craftsman with urgent news]

"Travelers! You must help us! Goblins have taken my daughter to the old mine!" His hands shake as he speaks. "I'll give you my finest weapons if you bring her back safely!"

[UPDATE_RELATIONSHIP: Gareth | +10 | Desperate plea for help]
[UPDATE_QUEST: Rescue Mission | active | Save Gareth's daughter from goblins in the old mine]

The other patrons murmur nervously - this is the third disappearance this month.
```

### Processing Results

The system automatically:
- Creates Gareth as an NPC with blacksmith role
- Initializes relationship at neutral + 10 (60 trust)
- Updates or creates the rescue quest
- Links Gareth to current tavern location
- Records interaction in history
- Updates faction standings if applicable

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Context Settings

- **Token Budget**: Adjust total context size (1000-8000 tokens)
- **History Depth**: Control how far back to look for relevant events
- **Importance Threshold**: Filter events by significance level
- **Location Focus**: Prioritize current location context

### Safety Settings

- **Entity Creation Limit**: Max entities per response (1-10)
- **Relationship Change Limit**: Max relationship changes (5-20)
- **Validation Level**: Strict, moderate, or lenient validation
- **Confirmation Required**: Require approval for major changes

### Performance Settings

- **Context Caching**: Cache frequent context requests
- **Background Processing**: Process non-critical updates asynchronously
- **Batch Operations**: Group related database updates
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup intervals

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Integration

```javascript
// Get comprehensive AI context
const context = await aiDMIntegration.getAIDMContext('social', {
    includeHistory: true,
    maxHistoryItems: 15,
    specificNPCs: ['Elara', 'Captain Marcus'],
    location: currentLocationId
});

// Process AI response
const results = await aiDMIntegration.processResponse(aiResponse);

// Results include:
// - processedResponse: Clean text with tags removed
// - entitiesCreated: Array of new entities
// - relationshipsUpdated: Array of relationship changes
// - questsUpdated: Array of quest progressions
// - errorsEncountered: Any validation failures
// - warnings: Potential consistency issues
```

### Event Integration

```javascript
// Listen for world changes that affect AI context
core.on('relationship:changed', () => {
    aiDMIntegration.invalidateContextCache(['relationships']);
});

core.on('location:changed', () => {
    aiDMIntegration.invalidateContextCache(['currentLocation', 'worldState']);
});

// Emit events for AI actions
core.emit('ai:entityCreated', { entityType: 'npc', entityId: npcId });
core.emit('ai:relationshipUpdated', { npcId, oldValue, newValue, reason });
```
