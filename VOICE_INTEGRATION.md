## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Voice Interaction
```
Player: "I want to search the room for treasure"
‚Üì (recognized with 85% confidence)
‚Üì (character context: Thorin the Dwarf)
‚Üì (sent to AI DM with voice context)
AI DM: "As Thorin searches the room..."
‚Üì (spoken via TTS)
```

### Voice Command Example
```
Player: "What do I know about Elara the merchant?"
‚Üì (recognized as database query command)
‚Üì (executes queryNPCKnowledge function)
System: "Elara is a merchant at the marketplace. Your relationship is friendly. You've spoken with her 3 times recently."
‚Üì (spoken via TTS)
```

### Character Context Example
```
Player: "Lyra says: I cast detect magic on the door"
‚Üì (speaker identified as Lyra)
‚Üì (current speaker set to Lyra)
‚Üì (sent to AI DM with Lyra as speaker context)
AI DM: "Lyra, your detect magic spell reveals..."
‚Üì (response includes character name)
```

## üîß Integration APIs

### Voice Command Registration
```javascript
// Register custom voice command
voiceIntegration.voiceCommands.set(
    'check my inventory', 
    async (parameter) => {
        // Custom command logic
        const items = await getInventoryItems();
        await voiceIntegration.speak(`You have ${items.length} items.`);
    }
);
```

### Character Voice Settings
```javascript
// Set character-specific voice
voiceIntegration.voiceSettings.characters.set(characterId, {
    voice: 'deep-male-voice',
    rate: 0.9,
    pitch: 0.8
});
```

### AI DM Voice Context Access
```javascript
// Access voice context in AI DM responses
const context = await aiDMIntegration.getAIDMContext('social', {
    voiceContext: {
        transcript: playerSpeech,
        speaker: currentCharacter,
        confidence: recognitionConfidence
    }
});
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Context Caching**: Cache frequent voice queries
- **Batch Processing**: Group related voice operations
- **Background Processing**: Process non-critical voice tasks asynchronously
- **Memory Management**: Clean up old voice recordings and transcripts
